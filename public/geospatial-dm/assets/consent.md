*Title of Research Study: Uncertainty Visualizations for Geospatial Decision-Making*

# Consent and Authorization Document

We are inviting you to take part in a research study. Please read the entire consent form in addition to this summary, 
ask questions, and take time to understand the study before you make any decision.

#### Purpose of the Study
This study aims to investigate how visualization can support reasoning about uncertainty in data presented on maps. You will be shown fictional data in a realistic scenario and asked to make resource allocation decisions. We compare performance across different display conditions to learn about how to best design visualizations to support decision-making.


#### Risks to study participants
Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analyses. As such,
your participation will remain anonymous and your responses will
not be used to identify you. In the unlikely event of a security breach, your responses and participation in the study could be uncovered, however, we are not collecting data on any sensitive topics. We use data encryption and password protection to minimize this risk.

#### Benefits to research participants and others
There may be no direct benefit to reserach participants.
The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data
visualization, along with helping inform the
development of future data exploration platforms.

#### Record keeping and confidentiality
Records of your participation in this study will be held
confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study
investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain
circumstances, the University of Chicago Institutional
Review Board (IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to
this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not
