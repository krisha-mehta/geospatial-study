On each trial you will view a map of a different state. In each map, the counties are divided into a grid of pixels. Each pixel represents one plausible estimate of that county’s poverty rate based on a model of survey data. The model is more confident that poverty is acute in counties that are more consistently red.

**Your task is to recommend the three counties** in each state that you think most urgently need additional resources. The state legislature has defined counties with urgent need as exceeding a poverty rate of 15% with 90% confidence based on available data. **You can maximize your bonus by only choosing counties that qualify.**

Click a county on the map to recommend it for resource allocation. The list of counties you select will appear at the bottom of the map. To locate a selected county, hover over its name in the list to highlight the matching area on the map. To deselect a county, click on the cross sign next to the name of that county.
