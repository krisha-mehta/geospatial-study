# Introduction

Welcome, and thank you for participating in our study. 

The study will present you with a series of maps in a fictional scenario and ask you to make judgments about resource allocation. You will play the role of a consultant for different U.S. states. You’ve been asked to help state governments allocate limited financial resources to specific counties in order to support children living under poverty. 

To make your recommendations, you will review maps showing the estimated poverty rate for children under 18 in each county. Because these data are estimates from a survey, they are inherently uncertain. Estimates in some counties are more reliable than others. The maps provide information about the poverty estimate for each county and its uncertainty.

States must decide carefully which counties should receive support. **Counties are only considered eligible for aid if there is a 90% chance that the poverty rate exceeds a threshold of 15%.** Participants will receive an additional bonus of $Z for each county they recommend that meets these criteria. You can maximize your bonus by only recommending counties that qualify.
