Welcome, and thank you for participating in our study.

Imagine you are a consultant for for different U.S. states. Your responsibility is to help state governments allocate limited financial resources to counties in order to support children living under poverty. Because funding is scarce, states must decide carefully which counties should receive more support.

To make your recommendations, you will review maps showing the poverty rate for children under 18 in each county. But this data is not perfect. Hence, alongside the poverty rate, the maps also provide information about the uncertainty in these estimates. Uncertainty in the estimates can arise due to various reasons such as error in sampling. 

## Task
On each trial, you will see a map of a state divided into counties. Your job is to choose the three counties that you think most urgently need additional resources. You should be 90% sure that the county you are choosing exceeds the 15% threshold level of acute poverty to successfully receive the funding.
